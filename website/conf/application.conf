# This is the main configuration file for the application.

application.langs="en"

# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.
# Default to Global in the root package.
# application.global=Global

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# application.router=my.application.Routes

# Database configuration

# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`

# To avoid issue http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20081134/play-framework-2-postgres-this-connection-has-been-closed:
#db.default.idleConnectionTestPeriod=10 seconds
#db.default.idleMaxAge=30 seconds
#db.default.maxConnectionAge=60 seconds

# ~~~~~
# You can disable evolutions if needed
# evolutionplugin=disabled

# by providing an application-logger.xml file in the conf directory.
